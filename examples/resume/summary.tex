Passionate about technology since high school, I studied Computer Science at the University of Padua which has given me a solid grounding in software engineering methodologies.

During my studies, I started frequenting the Community Programmers in Padua, which made me understand the importance of attending such events.   Furthermore, by participating in conferences like Droidcon and Codemotion, I extended my network of contacts and expanded my perspective on various technologies.

Since I started working, I've had the opportunity to work with different technologies and domains through which I maturated a better understanding of the different complexities within the software development world. Thanks to these experiences I have become more dynamic and flexible and capable of learning and productively using new technologies.
