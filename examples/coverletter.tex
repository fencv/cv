%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}
I am writing to apply for the position of software engineer which I saw published on the \href{https://www.performio.co/careers?gh_jid=4378255006}{\underline{https://careers.kaluza.com}}.

\lettersection{About Me}
During high school, I became passionate about the coding world so I decided to take a degree in Computer Science which has given me a solid grounding in software engineering methodologies.

During my previous jobs (3 years as a Software developer and 6 as a Software Engineer), I could work on abroad several fields from the backend to the DevOps fields. Furthermore, working with different companies with different methodologies, I have learned a lot of transferable skills becoming more flexible and able to relate with different kinds of people.

One of my major activities in the last 6 years was handling an internal project based on the open-source project \href{https://eclipse.dev/hawkbit/}{\underline{Hawkbit}} which I extended with some custom features written in Kotlin (Spring Boot) and Scala (Play). I have also written part of the IAC code for creating the Cloud Infrastructure on AWS using Pulumi, Helm, Docker, Gradle, Python and Typescript.

Until the middle of 2023, I was the main maintainer of the \href{https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hawkbit.hara}{\underline{Hara}} project (\href{https://github.com/eclipse-hara/hara-ddiclient}{\underline{source code}}) released under the Eclipse foundation, a project which I followed from the projectation to the realisation.

As well as the technical skills I’ve also improved my soft skills by mentoring some students during their internal period and leading a junior Android developer in his everyday work.

\lettersection{Current Visa}
I am living in Australia with the Working Holiday Visa which allows me to work full-time for a maximum of 6 months with the same employer (it expires in November 14th). After that, I’d like to continue to work for you with a sponsor visa.

Possibly, if you don't want to sponsor me, I plan to remain in Australia for another 6/8 months with a student visa to improve my English to a C1 level (my current English level is a B2). During my time as a student, I may work for you part-time for up to 48 hours every 14 days.
%\lettersection{Why Google?}

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I am a hard worker with a strong ethic, able to work in a team and individually. In this position, I will be able to give a valuable contribution to the application team with my knowledge of Java and object-oriented paradigms matured with years of experience.

I would very much appreciate it if you considered my application. I am available for an interview any weekday between 15:00 the 19:00 (except Friday 19th and Monday 22th).

I Look forward to hearing from you.
